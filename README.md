# basic_shoe_selling_EER

Shoes are identified by a unique product ID. Each shoe is considered unique. For example, a pair of womenâ€™s size 6 black Espirit shoes has product ID 57, while size 7 of the same style/color has a different product ID. The description, color and style of each shoe are stored. For each shoe, the department stocks several identical pairs. Thus, it must keep track of the quantity of each specific shoe in stock. 

A specific shoe will be sourced from one supplier. Suppliers are identified by a unique supplier ID and their name as well as contact number is stored. It is not uncommon for a particular supplier to supply many different shoes to the store. 

There is a need to keep track of customer purchases. Each customer is identified by a unique customer number. Additional information, such as name, and phone are also stored for each customer. Different customers have different buying habits. Some customers purchase only a single pair of shoes. Others purchase many different pairs. Information about a purchase includes the date of purchase. For each shoe purchased, it is important to capture the quantity purchased.

Each salesperson is identified by a unique employee number. Their name and surname is stored. Each sale is associated with a single salesperson.
